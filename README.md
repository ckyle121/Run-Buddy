# Run Buddy
This project creates structured HTML elements to satisfy specific accessibility standards that allow tools
such as screen readers to explain the page's content in a meaningful way to those who have a disability such as vision or hearing loss. 
By combining different CSS elements to style the webpage in a user friendly way, this project creates a landing page for Run Buddy, 
a service that lets runners sign up for personal training.

The image below shows the homepage of Run Buddy when users first visit the website.
